Objective was to design and develop a ride-sharing application. Drivers and riders can register as users of the application. The application can be used to let the riders schedule a ride, select the routing strategy between the possible routes (fastest time or shortest path), make payments, generate report (rides for a user), reserve parking space etc.

Following are the menu choices:
[1] Membership
[2] Vehicle Registration
[3] Ride
[4] Payment
[5] Notifications
[6] Parking
[7] Reports
[8] Quit
